# Polar-Coordinates

The polar coordinates of a point consist of distance r from a specified origin and an angle Î¸ with respect to the x-axis. The x and y coordinates of the point are related to its polar coordinates by the following:



This C program calculates the x and y coordinates of a user-input set of polar coordinates. This program is written to use simple header files and commands, and get accoustomed to the set up of using mathematical functions within C.
